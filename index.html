    <h1 id="header">Charity for foster kids</h1>
    <h2 id="header-2">
      I am going to do a charity for foster children that have been placed in a
      foster home. Most people do not know what fostering is all about but I
      will post a link below for more information. When a foster child gets
      placed they usually come with nothing but the clothes they have on,
      nothing more or nothing else. So what I am doing is collecting money for
      these kids to have toys and other things.
